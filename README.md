 Code and data to support Terry and Armitage (2023) 'Widespread analytical pitfalls in empirical coexistence studies and a checklist for improving their statistical robustness'


Code used R version 4.3.0 and R packages as available on CRAN on 9th June except for rstan, where the preview of rstan 2.26 is required. All knit html files contain a SessionInfo() detailing exact packages used. 

Some open data sourced from existing manuscripts is bundled here for convenience - do cite the original paper if that data is further reused.
